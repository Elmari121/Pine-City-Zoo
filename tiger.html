       <h3>TIGER</h3>
<p>
Tigers are the largest members of the cat family, scientifically classified under the genus *Panthera* and the species *Panthera tigris*. 
They are known for their powerful build, striped coats, and solitary nature. There are several subspecies, including the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, and Sumatran tiger. 
Tigers are native to parts of Asia, ranging from the Siberian taiga to the tropical forests of India and Southeast Asia.
</p>
<p>
One of the most striking features of tigers is their orange fur with black stripes, which helps them camouflage in their natural habitat. 
Each tiger has a unique pattern of stripes, much like human fingerprints. Tigers are excellent swimmers and often cool off in rivers and streams. 
They have strong jaws, sharp teeth, and retractable claws, making them highly effective predators.
</p>
<p>
Tigers are carnivorous and primarily hunt large prey such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. 
They are mostly active at night and can cover great distances while patrolling their territory. Due to habitat loss and poaching, tigers are currently listed as endangered.
</p>
<p>
WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?
</p>
<p>
You will find the tigers at pen B14, near the eastern observation deck and close to the big cat sanctuary.
